Nashville Short Term Rentals

Motivation

I moved to Nashville in 2013, and since then, the city has experienced significant growth in both housing purchases and rental markets. In recent years, short-term rental services like Airbnb have played a major role in reshaping the local hospitality industry, offering a popular alternative to traditional hotel accommodations. Known for its vibrant music scene, Nashville has become a hub for tourists and visitors. This project aims to analyze the trends within Nashville's short-term rental market, assessing its impact and identifying trends that could be valuable for stakeholders—including customers, current hosts, and potential investors.
