Nashville Short Term Rentals

Motivation

I moved to Nashville in 2013, and since then, the city has experienced significant growth in both housing purchases and rental markets. In recent years, short-term rental services like Airbnb have played a major role in reshaping the local hospitality industry, offering a popular alternative to traditional hotel accommodations. Known for its vibrant music scene, Nashville has become a hub for tourists and visitors. This project aims to analyze the trends within Nashville's short-term rental market, assessing its impact and identifying trends that could be valuable for stakeholdersâ€”including customers, current hosts, and potential investors.

Data Questions 

* How Airbnb listings evolved over the years?
* How have the number of short-term rental permits issued varied over the years, and how do they differ by permit type?
* How are Airbnb listings distributed with respect to their proximity to the airport and downtown? 
* What are the pricing trends of Airbnb listings over the years?

Data Source and Tools

The data for this project was sourced from Airbnb and Nashville.gov. The datasets were extracted into separate CSV files and support both time-based data analysis and data visualizations. The listings dataset provides summary information and key metrics for Airbnb listings in Nashville, while the short-term rental permits dataset from Nashville.gov contains details on permit applications for short-term rentals.

Tools

* Python/Pandas - for exploration and aggregation of the data 
* Jupyter Notebook 
* Power BI - for creating interactive dashboard 
* Git for version control

Conclusion

* There are currently 9,406 active Airbnb listings in Nashville, with 90% of these being entire homes or apartments. This makes Nashville Airbnb rentals highly desirable for customers who value personal space and prefer little to no shared areas with others during their stay. However, the overall trend for Airbnb rentals has declined since 2016, primarily due to increasing regulations. Many cities and towns have implemented housing policies to restrict short-term rentals, aiming to protect local residents. These regulations often limit stays to fewer than 30 consecutive days.
   
* Despite some fluctuations, the overall trend indicates an increase in permit applications. As of January 1, 2022, Metro Codes stopped approving new non-owner permits. These non-owner permits are now restricted to non-residential zoned areas. Of the current short-term rentals, 52.73% are multifamily buildings, while 35.82% are owner-occupied units and Non-owner-occupied units make up 11.45%. This shift indicates that short-term rental companies are increasingly focusing on multifamily buildings.

* For customer commute, the average distance of Nashville Airbnb rental listings from the Nashville Airport is just under 7 miles, and would be enticing to customers who prefer shorter commute times when heading to a rental as 55.32% of Nashville Airbnb Listings are within a 7 mile radius of the Nashville Airport while 44.68% of Nashville Airbnb listings are located beyond a 7 mile radius of the Nashville Airport

* For walkability or proximity to the Nashville downtown area, the average distance of Nashville Airbnb rental listings from the Downtown Nashville area is just under 3 miles, and would appeal to customers who prioritize walking or biking to the many attractions in the Nashville downtown area. For more context, 90.92% of Nashville Airbnb Listings are within a 3 mile radius of the Nashville Downtown area while 9.08% of Nashville Airbnb Listings are located beyond a 3 mile radius of the Nashville Downtown area.

* Average nightly rental prices vary across different neighborhoods and districts in the Nashville Airbnb ecosystem. The lowest average nightly rental prices are found in Districts 19, 6,32,31, and 16, while the highest average nightly rental prices are in Districts 34, 20, 25, 23, and 17. Current hosts can set their pricing based on these neighborhood and listing price differences, taking into account the specific restrictions in each district.
